# SwitchingReport

***WARNING: WIP! THIS MODULE IS SUBJECT OF CURRENT ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND IT IS NOT FUNCTIONAL YET***

This Python module can be used by electricity retailers
to generate the report Spanish regulators require about
consumer retailer switching.

Format definition is avaiable at: 
[CNMC website](http://cambiodecomercializador.cnmc.es/),
but requires user and password.
An old but open version is still available at the former regulator,
[OCSUM](http://www.ocsum.es/index.php/doc/formatos).

The module is coupled to the data model developed by Gisce
on the top of their OpenERP fork for electricity market agents.
