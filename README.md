This Python module can be used by electricity retailers
to generate the report Spanish regulators require about
consumer retailer switching.

Format definition is avaiable at: 
[CNMC website](http://cambiodecomercializador.cnmc.es/),
but requires user and password.
An old but open version is still available at the former regulator,
[OCSUM](http://www.ocsum.es/index.php/doc/formatos).

The module is coupled to the data model developed by Gisce
on the top of their OpenERP fork for electricity market agents.


## Requirements

### Native dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu

	$ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev libyaml-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

### Python dependencies

	$ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Testinga

### Running

To run the tests:

	$ python2 setup.py test

### Enabling database dependant tests

In order to run the database b2b tests you need to create a `dbconfig` module.
It should contain a dicctionary with the database configuration, in
a global var named `psycodb`.

If you don't have it, database dependant tests will be skipped.

### Enabling tests based on personal data

Also some b2b data contain personal data that cannot be
uploaded to the public repositories.
The strategy here, if you have access to the database,
is to run the tests before doing any changes to the code
to generate the reference data. So:

- Create the `b2bdata/personal` folder
- Run the test, instead of skip, personal data based test will fail
- Accept the new data generated

### Accepting or discarding modification to b2b data

Two scripts are provided:

- `acceptb2b.sh`: to turn `result` data in to the `expected`
- `discardb2b.sh`: to discard `result` data and stich with the current `expected`

Before accepting new data, take a close look at the changes.

## Concepts

The report is sent for a period of time, usually from the first of a month till the last day.
Requests are counted, not contracts, 
so that three requests of the same contract count as three, not one.

- **Sent requests ("Solicitudes enviadas"):**
    - Those sent during the period regardless its resolution.

- **Unanswered requests ("Solicitudes pendientes de respuesta"):**
    - Those without neither rejection nor acceptation answer from the distributor at the end of the period.
    - Warning: This could include requests started on previous periods.

- **Accepted requests ("Solicitudes aceptadas"):**
    - Those accepted within the period
    - Warning: This could include requests started on previous periods.

- **Rejected requests ("Solicitudes rechazadas"):**
    - Those rejected within the period
        - Direct rejection: C1/2:02 with rejection flag
        - After failed field intervention: C1/2:04
    - Includes also rejections because of field intervention after acceptation
    - Does not include rejections because of the format
    - Warning: This could include requests started on previous periods.

- **Unactivated requests ("Solicitudes pendientes de activacion"):**
    - Those accepted but not activated at the end of the period
    - Warning: This could include requests **send or accepted** on previous periods.
    - Plazo: desde la carga de la solicitud a final de mes

- **Activated requests ("Solicitudes activadas"):**
    - Those with activation date (C1/2:04) during the period
    - Warning: Not the reception date of C1/2:04, but the indicated activation date
    - Warning: This may include request **sent or accepted** on previous periods.
    - Includes later repositionated requests
    - Plazo: desde la carga de la solicitud a la fecha indicada para la activaci√≥n

- **Cancelled requests ("Solicitudes anuladas"):**
    - Those cancelled (C1/2:09 o A1:06)
    - Warning: the step that counts is the acceptation of the cancellation (C1/2:09) not the cancellation request (C1/2:08)
    - TODO: Ensure that 

- **Repositioned requests ("Solicitudes reposicionadas"):**
    - Those the outgoing
