# SwitchingReport

This Python module can be used by electricity retailers
to generate the report Spanish regulators require about
consumer retailer switching.

Format definition is avaiable at: 
[http://cambiodecomercializador.cnmc.es/](CNMC website),
but requires user and password.
An old but open version is still available at the former regulator,
[http://www.ocsum.es/index.php/doc/formatos](OCSUM).

The module is coupled to the data model developed by Gisce
on the top of their OpenERP fork for electricity market agents.
